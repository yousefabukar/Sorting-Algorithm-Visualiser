# **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**

## *A Python project for visualizing sorting algorithms*

This project provides a visual representation of the bubble sort algorithm using matplotlib. It creates an animated plot that shows how the algorithm rearranges elements step by step.

### Features

- Generates random data for sorting
- Visualizes many sorting algorithms in real-time
- Uses matplotlib for creating an animated line plot
- Customizable array size and animation speed
